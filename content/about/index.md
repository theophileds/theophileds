![Me looking grumpy during Christmas](writer.jpg)

I was first introduced to computers at the age of fifteen by playing World of Warcraft and somehow jumped on Backtrack 2 to overcome parental WiFi limitations, and have since, pursued my education in this area. Today, my interest is more focused on site reliability engineering and some aspects of effective communications. My ideal job would be to solve algorithmic challenges for the sake of it, while the more realistic one is to help companies make sense of DevOps.

My lifestyle is essentially nomadic: I live in different communities, and I spend the rest of my free time hunting for new surf spots, writing articles on Substack, or reading scientific books. I am also a philosopher at heart and genuinely enjoy facilitating deep conversations.
