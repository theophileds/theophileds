I started playing with computers at the age of 15 when I was introduced to Backtrack 2 – aka Kali Linux – and I have since pursued in this field for further study. Today, I'm more interested in site reliability engineering and some aspects of effective communications. My dream job would be to get paid to solve algorithmic challenges, while my more realistic one is to help companies understand what DevOps means.

My lifestyle is essentially nomadic, living in different communities, surfing between co-livings where I spend most of my free time writing articles – in an anonymous way – reading scientific non-fiction books and facilitating philosophical conversations because people tend to forget how authentic their opinions can be.
