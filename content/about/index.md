I started playing with computers at the age of 15 when I was introduced to Backtrack 2 - aka Kali Linux - and have since pursued this field for further study. Today, I'm more interested in site reliability engineering and some aspects of effective communications. My dream job would be to get paid to solve algorithmic challenges, while my more realistic one is to help companies understand what DevOps means.

My lifestyle is mostly nomadic, while living in community surfing between co-living. I spend the majority of my free time writing articles - as a ghostwriter, reading scientific non-fiction books, and facilitating philosophical conversations because I'm hypersensitive to small talk.
